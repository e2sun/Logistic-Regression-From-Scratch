# 📊 Lab 4 – Logistic Regression from Scratch

This repository contains the materials for **Lab 4**, where we implement the **Logistic Regression** algorithm from scratch using only Python and NumPy. This lab builds foundational understanding of machine learning models, gradient descent, and classification techniques.
